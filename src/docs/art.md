## Shapes
### Shape Count
The number of shapes in a box

### Hatching
The modulus value for deciding what shapes are hatched

### Size Range
The range of width and height to select box sizes from

## Positioning
### Grid
The number of rows and columns that shapes are distributed according to

### Spread
How much to spread the shapes positions away from the grid 0-100%

## Colors
### Root Color
A HSL color that the color palette is based on

HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness

Hue is a value from 0 to 360 degrees

Saturation and Lightness are both percentages from 0 to 100 

### Schemes
Each scheme is set of angle offsets from the root hue along the color wheel

This defines fixed relationships for the hues in a scheme

Complimenting hues are generated by adding these offsets to the root hue

### Schemes and their offset angles
- Triadic (0, 120, 240)
- Complimentary (0, 180)
- Tetradic (0, 60, 180, 240)
- Analogous (0, 30, 330)
- Analogous and Complimentary (0, 30, 180, 330)
- Split Complimentary (0, 150, 210)
- Complimentary and Analogous (0, 150, 180, 210)
- Series (0, 30, 60, 90)
- Square (0, 90, 180, 270)
- Mono (0)

### Gray Scale
The last 5 ids of each phase are assigned the exclusive gray scale Scheme with the saturation set to 0

### Shades
She number of lightness levels in a tokens palette

Distributed in a range from the root lightness minus the contrast to the root lightness

### Contrast
How wide a range of lightness to pick shades from.

defines a range of C% less than the root color for the color palette

## Mirroring
There are 3 Levels of mirroring

Each has its own position from 0 to 2400 in increments of 100

This specifies a position for an axis in the X and Y dimension

A final scale value for zooming in on basic mirroring schemes, default is 10 (100%)

## Animation
The animation is randomly selected.

Animation rendering may be disabled to show the static token art.

The duration modifier in the renderer allows you to adjust the length/speed of the animation.
